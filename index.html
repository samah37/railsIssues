                <h2>How do the number of issues evolve across time?</h2>
                <p> The graph illustrates the evolution of the number of the last 500 reported issues between 05-2017
                    and 03-2022 divided into periods of 3 months.
                    Overall, the number of issues from 2017 to 2020 was slightly stable between 5 and 20. At the end of
                    2020, there was a sharp rise in the number of issues. The latter has slumped since the beginning of
                    the year 2022, the number of reported issues has decreased from 140 to 100.
                    In 2017, the number of issues was nearly 5 (1%). Over the following three years (05/2017-05/2020),
                    there is a gradual fluctuation in the number of the issues which varies between 5 and 20
                    approximately, the global percentage in this period is almost 40%. Between 05/2020 and 08/2020, we
                    notice that the number of issues has slightly exceeded 20 but it decreases to 15 in the next 3
                    months. From 11/2020 to 01/2022, the number of issues has incredibly increased to reach
                    approximately 140 issues at the end of 2020 which is 28% of the total number. The number of issues
                    has decreased in the last period from 140 to 100 which represents 10% of the total number.

                <h2>Are there any periods in which we get more issues?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the previous graph, we notice that in the last years (2020-2022) more issues has been
                    reported in this repository , if we relate this with the current conditions we can say that the
                    github has become more active in general terms because of the remote work due to the pandemic
                    (Covid-19). In this period, the rails project contributors and developers asked their problems and
                    issues online to get a coherent answer.

                <h2>What is the most popular category (label)?</h2>
                <p> The bar chart illustrates the occurences of each label in the last 500 issues of rails project.
                    It can be seen that there are labels more popular than others. Starting with the least used labels,
                    we can notice that there are categories which are used only one to fifteen times such as:
                    thirdpartyissues, il8n, actionmailer ..ect. When we find that there are labels which are used
                    between twenty and one hundred. For example: attachedPR, docs … ect. At the end we find the
                    activerecord label which is used 208 times.
                    To answer the question, activerecord is the most popular category (208 times). We can explain this
                    by saying that most of the problems found by users are in the class of activerecord. These labels
                    will allow the project manager to update his code by modifying the part where the majority find an
                    issue.

                <h2>Is there anyone who reports more issues than others?</h2>
                <p> The graph illustrates the number of issues reported by each user (of the last 500 issues) where each
                    user is represented by his unique identifier (User ID). A user reports at least one issue.
                    Overall, we can notice that there are 368 users on 500 issues. So, automatically there are users who
                    have reported more than one issue. According to the graph, we can also observe that 83% of users
                    have reported one issue and 17% have reported a variety of issues (10, 5, 3 …). The user with ID
                    771968 has reported 19 issues more than all the other users.
                    To answer the question, we can say that yes, there is a user who reports more issues than others. In
                    this case he is the user with ID 771968 who has reported 19 issues.
                    We can explain these results by saying that there are users who have more issues than others when
                    trying to run the project and this can be related to their working environment, setups, machine
                    performances, skills … etc.

                <h2>How issues apparition evolves compared to their status change and discussion activity across the
                    time?</h2>
                <p> The graph illustrates the evolution of the number of the last 500 reported, updated and closed
                    issues and the comments number between 05-2017 and 03-2022 divided into periods of 3 months.
                    Overall, we notice that in all the period of the time, the 500 issues have been updated but no issue
                    has been closed. For the comments number, it is so observable that it is related to the number of
                    the issues. The number of comments from 2017 to 2020 was in oscillation between 20 and 200. Between
                    05/2020 and 08/2020 the number of comments increased to 300 approximately. At the end of 2020, there
                    was a sharp rise in the number of issues and comments together which have increased since the
                    beginning of the year 2022, the number of reported issues and comments have decreased from 140 to
                    100 and from more than 500 to less than 200 respectively.
                    To answer the question, we can say that the issues on github are not all closed because the problem
                    exists already, also the comments number shows that more issues are reported the more the repository
                    is active with more interactions. The issues on github are not ignored by the users and they all
                    collaborate to find a solution to these issues by commenting, asking and updating their
                    interactions.

            <h2>Synthesis</h2>
            <p> At the end of this study we can conclude that github is a very good tool which has many advantages
                proven by the analyzes made previously. During this project, we learned that the github facilitates
                collaboration between users by allowing them to report an issue, comment on it and update it in order to
                help the user to achieve the desired result easily. In addition, we find that the activity of users
                differs from one user to another which surely has several reasons citing among them: user experience,
                user environment, …ect. Through this study, we noticed that during the pandemic the activity on github
                doubled several times, which showed us that collaboration has no limits, if you have a project just put
                it in github and you can track it and interact with different users around the world on github.
